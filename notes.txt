What types of scripts and stuff do we need?
- background scripts, for initialization?
- page actions / browser actions? what's the difference?
  - Show a popup interface and a button to autolink.
- content scripts, to modify the textarea content? (these have to communicate with other
    components via message passing!)
??
- somewhere add keyboard shortcuts for
  - link selected word
  - autolink edited entry
