TBD:
- Will the autolinker only link to existing entries? (That could be a setting.) If so, the extension may need to use the wiki APIs to query lists of headwords starting with a certain prefix.
- How do I get the text changes made by this extension to be part of the Undo/Redo stack?
  See https://stackoverflow.com/a/39948207/423105: use execCommand("insertText") and related functions.
